# Formations

Explanation or teaching must be avoided while formed in columns. To involve the Scouts more they should be brought to form a half circle where the shorter Scouts stay in the front. Gather around when teaching a song or a lesson at all times.

## Closed Columns and Open Columns

Close column formation is line by line in rows facing the DSL. Arms distance must be the correct space in between the patrols.&#x20;

However when the Open Columns is commanded, If 3 Patrols are formed line by line:

* Last Patrol should move 2 steps to the back
* Second patrol should move 1 step to the back
* First Patrol doesn't move

When 7 Patrols are formed

* 7th (Last) Patrol should take 6 steps to the back
* 6th Patrol should take 5 steps to the back
* 5th Patrol should take 4 steps to the back
* 4th Patrol should take 3 steps to the back
* 3rd Patrol should take 2 steps to the back
* 2nd Patrol should tale 1 step to the back
* 1st Patrol does not move

## Reporting in Formation

Except for the circle formation and the height order formation, the patrol formation protocol must be followed. The patrol call protocol must be entertained.

In a circle formation the Duty Patrol must be infront of the DSL after forming the circle

## Horse Shoe Formation

Horse shoe formation **no longer needs** to be in "**Arms between members and double arms between Patrols**", therefore the patrols **need to leave an arm distance between patrols and the patrol members feet should slightly touch others toes; means only elbow distance is maintained**. This ensures everyone in the formation to be involved and everyone could hear what the conductor/DSL says.

Horse shoe formation starting point (Duty Patrol) and Ending point (Next Duty Patrol) do not need to be in a straight line and the shape of a horse show should be maintained; means an arc should be maintained.
