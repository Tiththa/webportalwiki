# Introduction

Many changes were adapted to Scouting in Sri Lanka after each phase IV course is held. Practical issues are taken seriously and solutions are provided. The SLSA NHQ follows this procedure hence the district training team follows this procedure and requests troops to follow this protocol as well.

These adapted methodologies and other content are uploaded after the District Training Team who are national level trainers conducted the Phase 2 camp at Sharasthananda Vidyalaya Dehiwala from 26th to 28th August 2022. Two representees were present; Scout Leader Ravindu Hulladduwa and ASL Tithira Jayasekera.
