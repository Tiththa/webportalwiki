# Saturday Programme

## Programme Duration

It is recommended that the Scouting Programme is conducted to be with a maximum duration of **90 minutes** although certain troops follow different protocols. However the standard programme items have to be in a programme and strictly monitored. Our troop starts Scouting at 2PM and finishes off at 5:30PM

## Programme Format

The recommended programme format is as follows:

1. Opening Rally
2. Warm up game (Very active and energetic) - Short Game
3. Yell from both sides if a two team game to the above game or a common yell in a formation
4. Project/Lesson
5. Yell or a short Scout song - Not lengthy (Song)&#x20;
6. Tea
7. Long game&#x20;
8. Closing Rally

### 1. Opening Rally

Opening Rally duration should not exceed 10 minutes and it not practical to exceed this duration

The horse shoe formation starting point and ending point has changed.&#x20;

* The conductor who bears a whistle stands 3 feet away to the front of the horse shoe from the flag pole.&#x20;
* Horse shoe formation **no longer needs** to be in "**Arms between members and double arms between Patrols**", therefore the patrols **need to leave an arm distance between patrols and the patrol members feet should slightly touch others toes; means only elbow distance is maintained**. This ensures everyone in the formation to be involved and everyone could hear what the conductor/DSL says.
* Horse shoe formation starting point (Duty Patrol) and Ending point (Next Duty Patrol) do not need to be in a straight line and the shape of a horse show should be maintained; means an arc should be maintained.
* The conductor does not say anything to the next Senior who himself goes and invite to the opening rally. He hands-over the conducting whistle to the next in-line (Senior) followed up with a: This protocol is followed as the final commander is the Duty Scout Leader.
  * Salute - Say nothing (No "Troop is ready for Opening Rally sir!")
  * Hand-over the whistle
  * Shake Hands
  * Salute
* The last person to come and start the rally must posses the whistle.
* When "Duty, Flag" is commanded, the DPL **does not need to step 3 steps to the front and turn towards the flag pole, march towards the flag pole**. Instead, **DPL turns towards the flag pole where he is at in the rally and marches smartly via the shortest path to the flag and turn towards the flag pole**. Maintain a distance of 1 feet from the flag pole.
* After the flag break, the conductor steps one foot back from the flag pole and salute. As he salutes and brings his hand down the troop **must start singing the National Anthem**.
* Greetings from the DSL, followed up with
  * **Religious observances** must be followed up&#x20;
  * A **thought of the day**&#x20;
  * Any announcements
  * Marking the attendance Patrol wise and not troop wise
    * The Patrol leaders take one step forward and salute all at once
    * Patrol leaders turns towards the patrol to a count and marches to the middle of patrol. He has a Notebook with the names and the date. He marks the attendance book and after he is done he faces towards the inside of the horse shoe. All at once, the Patrol Leaders turn towards the DSL (the conductor) and all at once marches smartly towards the DSL from the middle or where the PLs at forming a line where DPL always stays on right. The DPL says "**PLs, Salute**" and the PLS salute to the DSL. DSL collects all the books and handsover to the Seniors who marks the troop register. This saves a lot of time as the current "Troop register marking" is heavily inefficient. Then the DPL commands "PLs, Alert!" followed up with a "PLs Salute!" then proceed to join back their patrols after a "PLs Dismiss".
  * The DSL can inspect the Scouts while in the rally. On a uniform day, only the Uniformed leaders may inspect the Uniformed Scouts. On a casual day the ASLs or Seniors may join in to inspect.
  * Dismissing the rally and not breaking off

### 2. Warm Up Game (Active and Energetic)

The reason behind the warm game is to make Scouts active and make more involved in the next activities in-line. This game has to be very active. It would be better if the troop is split into 2 teams and conduct a game suitable like:

* Dog and the bone
* Handkerchief fight just like the dog and the bone
* Cock fight

Give points to the teams and make it competitive. Make 2 rounds and after the rounds, you may ask both teams to congratulate the other team by giving out a Scout Yell. Lost team congratulates the Winning team with a yell and involve everyone and the winning team congratulates the lost team with a Scout Yell.

With time Scout will know many Scout Yells and are requested to find or make new Scout Yells each day and not use yells repeatedly. The Scout Leader or the conductor explains that it is not all about winning and we have to learn to accept defeat. When winning team about to conduct the yell, the yell conductor congratulates the lost team for making it competitive and wishes best of luck for the next time. Same scenario plays for the lost team and it continues.
