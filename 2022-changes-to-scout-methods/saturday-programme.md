# Saturday Programme

## Programme Duration

It is recommended that the Scouting Programme is conducted to be with a maximum duration of **90 minutes** although certain troops follow different protocols. However the standard programme items have to be in a programme and strictly monitored. Our troop starts Scouting at 2PM and finishes off at 5:30PM

## Programme Format

The recommended programme format is as follows:

1. Opening Rally
2. Warm up game (Very active and energetic) - Short Game
3. Yell from both sides if a two team game to the above game or a common yell in a formation
4. Project/Lesson
5. Yell or a short Scout song - Not lengthy (Song)&#x20;
6. Tea
7. Long game&#x20;
8. Closing Rally

### 1. Opening Rally

Opening Rally duration should not exceed 10 minutes and it not practical to exceed this duration

The horse shoe formation starting point and ending point has changed.&#x20;

* The conductor who bears a whistle stands 3 feet away to the front of the horse shoe from the flag pole.&#x20;
* Horse shoe formation **no longer needs** to be in "**Arms between members and double arms between Patrols**", therefore the patrols **need to leave an arm distance between patrols and the patrol members feet should slightly touch others toes; means only elbow distance is maintained**. This ensures everyone in the formation to be involved and everyone could hear what the conductor/DSL says.
* Horse shoe formation starting point (Duty Patrol) and Ending point (Next Duty Patrol) do not need to be in a straight line and the shape of a horse show should be maintained; means an arc should be maintained.
* The conductor does not say anything to the next Senior who himself goes and invite to the opening rally. He hands-over the conducting whistle to the next in-line (Senior) followed up with a&#x20;
  * Salute - Say nothing
  * Hand-over the whistle
  * Shake Hands
  * Salute
* The last person to come and start the rally must posses the whistle.
* When "Duty, Flag" is commanded, the DPL **does not need to step 3 steps to the front and turn towards the flag pole, march towards the flag pole**. Instead, **DPL turns towards the flag pole where he is at in the rally and marches smartly via the shortest path to the flag and turn towards the flag pole**. Maintain a distance of 1 feet from the flag pole.
* After the flag break, the conductor steps one foot back from the flag pole and salute. As he salutes and brings his hand down the troop **must start singing the National Anthem**.
