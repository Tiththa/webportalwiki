# Reporting

The Patrol calls must be used to report a patrol at all times. The Patrol call is designated to a patrol and it must be unique. This is official language to call the patrol members and not by the name of the patrol.

Eg:&#x20;

* Parrots - Creek, Creek
* Woodpecker - Creek Tok Tok Tok

When a whistle is blown for a formation, the whole patrol should come running by calling this patrol call. The PL cannot report if a patrol member is missing and continue to shout by the patrol call.It should not be stopped.

Patrol call can be used when a patrol member had brought great achievement to the patrol and may celebrate by doing the patrol call. This patrol call must be encouraged among the Scouts.
