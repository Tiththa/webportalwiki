# Funeral Service

The Service instructions were provided by Group Advisor Sujiv Fonseka on 16th August, 2022 for a in-service staff member in school.

## Tutorial

It should be 2 or 4 responsible senior scouts to place the Prep school flag on the coffin once it is closed before loading into the hearse. The same seniors to go to the Cathedral (where they will be taking the body) and remove the flag before the coffin is opened. The flag should be folded and unfolded for the above occasions smartly. Flag to be folded on the side of the closed coffin, **NOT** above the closed coffin, so you need to lift the flag and side step with it unfurled, then fold it on the side

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note you **DO NOT** fold the scout flag the way it is done in the video, and **NO NEED** for all these theatrics- you are not putting on a military display. Just do a simple fold of the flag so only one person is left holding it, turn again to face the coffin for a moment, and then break off and walk away smartly
