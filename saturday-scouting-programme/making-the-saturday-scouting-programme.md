# Making the Saturday Scouting Programme

### Default Format

When organizing Saturday Scouting Programmes there is a methodology the group follow;

The Programme should be formatted this way for regular Saturday Scout meetings

1. Arrival and Cleanup
2. Opening Rally
3. Inspection
4. `<space 1>`
5. Short game
6. `<space 2>`
7. Tea Break
8. `<optional space>`
9. Long game
10. Closing Rally

`<space 1> <space 2> <optional space>` can be used to line up the items you are planning to do.&#x20;

### Inspection

### Short Game

Short game is formatted to be first and the **ideal duration is set to be in-between 10-15 minutes**. This is due to if Scouts are tired from a Long game in the beginning of the Scouting Programme, they will continue to be tired throughtout the programme. Be aware of the Scout's age groups (11-15). A 15 year old Scout would not be tired as a 11 year old Scout. This can be the opposite as well.&#x20;

Use Scouting Resources to organize creative Short games which build team spirit, patrol sprit in an enjoyable way. Use dumpscoutcan for game ideas and search for other ideas available to you online. Some links have been referenced for you.

### Long Game

Long game unlikely the Short Game can be an enojyable event. **The ideal duration is 20-30 minutes**. It is highly discouraged to play ordinary games;

* Cricket
* Football
* High catches/Low catches

Aforementioned games are discouraged to play as a Scout himself attends Scouting to expect uncommon games.

### Special Programmes

When you have an extensive linup for your Saturday Scouting programme, you can alter the default format. It is advisable that you include a tea break and you can alter inspection as well. There are number of cases where you can alter the default format when you;

* Organize pioneering/craft projects
* Organize trails/practical sessions
* Organize full day programmes

Opening rally and the Closing rally are a must even in a special programme
